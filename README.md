ProjectTitle: My Awesome Responsive Repo

Description: A developer must always showcase his/or learning through projects. However, a portfolio is just as essential as doing projects to show the world what kind of person they are. I have learned a lot since I first began learning, so I have made a new portfolio site that is more polished, dynamic and appealing.
