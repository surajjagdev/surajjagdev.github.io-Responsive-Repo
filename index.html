            <p1 id="paragraph"> I was born on October 25, 1995 in the city of Etibioke. From a young age I always had different passions in life
                on what I wanted to become when I grew older. When I was just 10 years old, I wanted to be a soccer player;
                even though I was always chosen last for my team because didn't have an ounce of talent. However, what I
                had was dedication and with a lot of hard work and patience I became a below-average soccer player. My passion
                soon died in becoming a soccer player and I became a fan of the sport instead.During this time however, I
                fell in love with technology.
                <br></br>

                I still remember the first computer I had bought, a Dell Dimension 2400 desktop with a cathode ray tube monitor running the
                then trendy Windows XP. A dinosaur by this day and age, but an efficent machine in its day. It was the first
                machine that led me to fall in love with the Internet and its idea of connecting the globe without physical-contact.
                The desktop eventually was overrun by malware, viruses and slowed down a lot.


                <br></br>
                <!--break in page, w/o making new paragraph and styling it-->

                With exposure to technology, I was ready to have a career in the technolgy field, however I reluctantly decided to study
                Biology. My passion in Biology was bleak, but I finished my degree and found an oppurtunity on the Internet
                to become what I felt was best suited for me, a FullStack Developer. Currently enrolled in the program, I
                feel more challenged and engaged than I ever was. By the end of the program I will put all of my skills to
                good use.
